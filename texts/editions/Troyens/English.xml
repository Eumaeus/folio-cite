                            noise. Aeneas is asleep on his bed, half-armed. Ascanius comes out of a

                            father’s bed. The city noise fades; he dare not wake his father, and
                            turns away from him. From a dark corner the bloody ghost of Hector
                            advances slowly and solemnly towards Aeneas. His beard and hair are
                            dirty and disheveled. Arriving by Aeneas, he remains motionless for a
                            moment, looking at him, and sighs deeply. The noise of a collapsing
                            building, louder than the previous ones, startles and awakens Aeneas. He
                            sees Hector standing in front of him and after a moment of hesitation he
                            addresses him, half rising from his bed..</stage>

                        <stage n="stage94">An African forest by morning. At the back, a towering rock. To the
                            left and at the foot of the rock, the mouth of a cave. A stream runs
                            around the rock and flows into a natural pond bordered by bulrushes and
                            reeds. Two naiads (river nymphs) appear for a brief moment before
                            vanishing, then reappear swimming in the pond. Royal hunt. Horn fanfares
                            sound from afar in the forest. The frightened naiads hide in the reeds.
                            We see Tyrian hunters pass by, holding dogs on leads. Young Ascanius
                            gallops across the stage on horseback. The sky turns dark; rain falls
                            and becomes a growing storm. Soon the terrible tempest intensifies, with
                            torrential rain, hail, lighting and thunder. The hunting horns sound in
                            the midst of the tumultuous weather. The hunters scatter; and finally we
                            see Dido, dressed as Diana the huntress, holding a bow, with a sheath of
                            arrows over her shoulder, and Aeneas in semi-military dress. They are
                            both on foot. As they enter the cave, wood nymphs appear atop of the
                            rock, their hair disheveled, and run back and forth, shouting and
                            gesticulating wildly. In the midst of their clamor, we can at times make
                            out the word: Italy! The stream swells and becomes a noisy torrent.
                            Several other waterfalls surge at various points of the rock, and add
                            their noise to the crashing of the storm. In the darkness satyrs and
                            wood people dance grotesquely with the fauns. Lightning strikes a tree,
                            shatters it and sets it on fire. Fragments of the tree fall upon the
                            stage. The satyrs, fauns, and wood people, still dancing, take up the
                            burning branches, then together with the nymphs vanish into the depths
                            of the forest. The storm recedes. The clouds lift.</stage>

                                Anna kneels to the right of the stage with Narbal to the left.
